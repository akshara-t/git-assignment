[The Future of Software Development: Programmers and AI Pair Programming](https://jisem-journal.com/index.php/journal/article/view/13556)

### Why I Find This Article Interesting

I found this article interesting because it explains how artificial intelligence is changing the way software developers write code. Instead of working alone, developers can now use AI tools as “pair programmers” that help with code completion, debugging, and learning new patterns. The article shows how these tools can reduce repetitive work and help developers focus more on problem-solving and design.

What also stood out to me is that the article does not present AI as a replacement for developers. Instead, it emphasizes collaboration between humans and machines. It discusses both the benefits and the challenges, such as over-reliance on AI and the need for developers to still understand the code they write. This made the article feel balanced and realistic, especially for the future of software engineering careers.
